# Phase 2 Phase 3 Project: CLI

## Problem Statement
There is a challenge in getting venues for various events in my locality. There is need for a database where users can find information about available venues for their events. 

## Solution
In this project I develop a CLI application where users can search available venues for their events. Users can also list available venues in the database as well are remove venues that are no longer available. They can also use the database to create events and invite guests to their events as well as cancel event.
